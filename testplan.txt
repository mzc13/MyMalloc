Test Case E:
This test case was used to ensure mymalloc works even when we fill the array to maximum capacity.
The test case splits myBlock in half, and in each half it allocates either one pointer for the 
entire half, or enough pointers to fill the half with one byte allocations. Since our metadata is
two bytes, one pointer that fills half of myBlock would be size 2046 bytes, and 682 pointers each
with size one byte would also fill half of myBlock. After myBlock is filled, all the pointers are
freed. This is repeated 10 times.

Test Case F:
This test case was used to ensure mymalloc actually returns useable pointers. The test case fills
all of myBlock with 1365 allocations each one byte large. After each pointer is returned, a char
is stored at the memory location. Then, all the pointers are dereferenced and the value is compared
to the char that was originally stored. If this test fails, it would mean our library is not
working properly. This test case is also repeated 10 times.
